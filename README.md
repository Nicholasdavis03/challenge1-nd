# Code Refactor Starter Code

I refactored the code.
I addded alts to the pics that explained what the visuals were
I reordered the headings, so they werent all over the place and misordered
I chagned the title to more accurately portray the site

Most of the the elements were non-semantic, they have been revamped.

Thank you for the patience and help.
